Documentation
-------------

This plugin let's you limit what happens in a world.

It is able to:

* Protect worlds from griefers.  Only players within an auth list
  and/or certain permissions are allowed to place or destroy blocks.
* Per world PvP.  Prevents PvP matches in specific worlds.
* Create limits in your limitless worlds.  So players attempting are
  not able to work beyond a preset border.  This is useful if you want
  to avoid overloading the server by generating new Terrain.
* Limit the number of players in a world.
* Show a text file when players enter a world.  To explain players
  what is allowed (or not allowed) in specific worlds.  For example
  you could warn players when they are entering a PvP world.

Note that limiting players in a world is only supported by
[ManyWorlds](http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/manyworlds.1042/)
and any plugin that uses ManyWorlds teleport functionality.

### Commands:

Informational:

* motd [level]  
  Show a level specific _message of the day_ type text.
* wp motd [level] _text_  
  Modify the motd text for the specified level (or the current level).
  While you can only enter a single line through this command, you can
  have a multi-line MOTD by modifying the per-world configuration file.

Protect:

* wp lock [level]  
  Place/destroy block is *not* allowed.  Not even for ops.  This is
  useful for adventure style worlds.
* wp protect [level]  
  Place/destroy block is allowed for players that have
  `wp.cmd.protect.auth` permission (by default *ops*) or players in
  the `auth` list. (See add/rm sub-commands).
* wp unlock|unprotect [level]
  Placing/destroying blocks are allowed.
* wp status [level]
  Will show the lock/protect status of a world.


Per-world PvP:

* wp pvp [level] [on|off]  
  If nothing is specified it will show the PvP status of the current
  level.  Otherwise PvP will either be activated|de-activated.

World borders:

* wp border [level] [x1 z1 x2 z2|none]  
  If nothing is specified it will show the current borders.  If `none`
  the current borders will be removed.  Otherwise a border will be set
  by the (x1,z1) - (x2,z2) coordinates.

Player Limits:

* wp max [level] [count]  
  If nothing is specified will show the current player limits.
  Otherwise the world limit will be set by `count`.  Set to `0` for
  limitless worlds.

Auth list:

* wp add [level] *player*
* wp rm [level] *player*

These commands add or remove players from the world's `auth` list.
Access to these commands is controlled by standard PocketMine
permission system.  When a world's `auth` list is defined, access to
these commands are restricted to the people in the `auth` list.

	settings:
	  player-limits: true
