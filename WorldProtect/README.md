## Documentation

**NOTE: v2.0.0 is a complete rewrite.  Please test your settings
carefully when upgrading**

This plugin let's you limit what happens in a world.

It is able to:

* Protect worlds from griefers.  Only players within an auth list
  and/or certain permissions are allowed to place or destroy blocks.
* Per world PvP.  Prevents PvP matches in specific worlds.
* Create limits in your limitless worlds.  So players attempting are
  not able to work beyond a preset border.  This is useful if you want
  to avoid overloading the server by generating new Terrain.
* Limit the number of players in a world.
* Show a text file when players enter a world.  To explain players
  what is allowed (or not allowed) in specific worlds.  For example
  you could warn players when they are entering a PvP world.
* Create unbreakable blocks.
