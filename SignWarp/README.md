SignWarp
========

A very basic Plugin implementing simple _Sign_ based warps.

Basic Usage:

Place a Sign with the following text:

	[SWARP]
	x y z

Where `x`, `y` and `z` are numbers containing the target warp
coordinates.

Documentation
-------------

This plugin implements _warps_ through the placement of _signs_.  You
need to create a sign with the text:

	[SWARP]
	x y z

`x`, `y` and `z` are integers containing the target coordinates for
this warp.  Only *ops* can create _warps_.

To activate a _warp_ the player must touch a sign.  That will teleport
the player to the new location described by the `x`, `y`, `z`
coordinates.

The third and four lines of the sign are ignored and can be used to
describe the _warp_.

To help identify potential _warp_ targets, the command `xyz` is
provided.  Entering `/xyz` in-game will display the current
coordinates of the player.

### Permission Nodes:

* signwarp.cmd.xyz - Allows the user to show current x,y,z coordinates

TODO
----

* Add support for MultipleWorlds:
  * to spawn point
  * to a specific x,y,z coordinate

Changes
-------

* 1.0.0 : First release
